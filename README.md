# Dark Dracula Gray theme for HyperTerm

####[HyperTerm](https://hyperterm.org) theme based on [the **Hyperterm Gooey** Syntax theme](https://github.com/simeydotme/hyperterm-gooey).  

A dark gray version of the dark dracula theme, similar to the [dark dracula theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=gerane.Theme-Dark-Dracula) for Visual Studio Code.

I am not a javascript dev, this is just a differently colored version of 
[the **Hyperterm Gooey** Syntax theme](https://github.com/simeydotme/hyperterm-gooey) I made to match the rest of my environment. 

Tested on Windows and Ubuntu.
